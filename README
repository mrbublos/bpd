Installation:

1.install maven/java 8
2. run: mvn clean install
3. run: generator-windows-amd64.exe | java -jar target/bpd.jar (on linux should work the same)
4. access via web: http://localhost:8080/

Improvements:
1. Web api handling is not non-blocking, but i guess that was not the task (can be switched to selectors)
2. More generic thread management for each pub/sub part, since theres a lot of common stuff, and hence boilerplate code
3. More generic task, so lots of them can be chained and fine tuned without lots of effort, no separate thread for task management
